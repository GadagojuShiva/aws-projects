# Real-time Application Deployment on AWS EKS

Welcome to the project repository for our Real-time Application Deployment on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) project. In this project, we'll explore the process of deploying a practical, real-time application on the AWS EKS platform, demonstrating how to configure a Kubernetes cluster, create a service, set up an Ingress controller, and provide external access to the application through a load balancer.

## Project Overview

AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. In this project, we will dive deep into AWS EKS to showcase our proficiency in deploying real-time applications and working with Kubernetes.

### Key Achievements

- Created a highly available AWS EKS cluster.
- Deployed a Kubernetes service to manage application traffic.
- Configured an Ingress controller for external access.
- Designed a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets.
- Installed and configured a real-time application within a private subnet.
- Ensured the stability and security of the EKS environment.
- Developed strong skills in managing Kubernetes clusters on AWS.
