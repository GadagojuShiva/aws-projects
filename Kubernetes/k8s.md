# Kubernetes Architecture and Components

This README provides an overview of the Kubernetes architecture and its core components. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes follows a master-worker architecture, with the following key components:

### Master Node

The master node is responsible for managing the overall cluster and its components include:

1. **API Server**: The central management point for the entire cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which users, administrators, and components interact with to control the cluster.

2. **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that stores all cluster data, including configuration details and the state of the cluster.

3. **Controller Manager**: Watches for changes to the desired state of resources in the cluster (e.g., pods, services) and ensures the actual state matches the desired state.

4. **Scheduler**: Assigns work (i.e., pods) to worker nodes based on resource availability and constraints.

### Worker Node

Worker nodes are the machines where containers are deployed, and they consist of:

1. **Kubelet**: Ensures containers are running in a Pod and reports their status to the control plane.

2. **Kube Proxy**: Maintains network rules on nodes to enable network communication to Pods.

3. **Container Runtime**: Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

## Core Components

### Pods

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process. Pods can contain one or more containers that share network and storage resources.

### Services

Services provide a stable endpoint for accessing a set of Pods. They enable load balancing and service discovery within the cluster.

### Replication Controllers/ReplicaSets

These controllers ensure a specified number of identical Pods are running, allowing for scaling and fault tolerance.

### Deployments

Deployments provide declarative updates to applications, making it easy to roll out changes to Pods and ReplicaSets.

### ConfigMaps and Secrets

ConfigMaps store configuration data, while Secrets store sensitive information. They can be used to decouple configuration from the container image.

### Namespaces

Namespaces provide a way to group and isolate resources within a cluster, helping to organize and manage large-scale deployments.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kubernetes, you can use various tools and platforms, such as [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), or cloud providers like [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) or [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).
